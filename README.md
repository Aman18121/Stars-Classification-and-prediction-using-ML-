# Stars-Classification-and-prediction-using-ML-
Hi, my name is **Aman Yadav**. I am currently pursuing my **Masterâ€™s in Life Science Informatics**. Before joining university, stars and space have always fascinated me, sparking my curiosity about the universe.
I have a deep interest in **astrophotography** and the study of **star alignments and classifications**. This project is my independent endeavor to explore something related to my hobby while integrating my knowledge of **data visualization, manipulation, and machine learning**.
The dataset for this project has been sourced from Kaggle (**https://www.kaggle.com/code/ybifoundation/stars-classification**). Through this work, I aim to blend my passion for astronomy with my expertise in computer science, creating meaningful insights into the classification of stars.
This project is based on a dataset containing 240 entries of stars along with their various features. Our goal is to predict the type of star, represented by the **"Spectral Class"** column, using different features and multiple machine learning models.

We will analyze the accuracy of these models before and after applying **Bagging** to observe performance differences. This study will help us understand how Bagging improves classification accuracy and explore further enhancements that can be made.
